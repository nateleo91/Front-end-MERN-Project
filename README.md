- Delete a previously selected food item using the "DELETE" function.
- View the nutrition facts for the selected food item per serving.
- Track your daily food intake using a meal tracking table that contains four meal types - breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks - each with their respective calorie, carbohydrate, fat, protein, sodium, and sugar values.
- Click the "Add Food" link in each row to open a popup window that allows you to search for and select a food item, which updates the corresponding nutrient values for the selected meal.
